They also consider internal data, such as the car's speed and engine status so the vechicle can make decisions about driving.\n","\n","Netflix Recommendation System (1.2):\n","\n","Netflix has a recommendation system to provide a better experience by suggesting content personalised to the user. Therefore, it looks at your preferences, what you have watched in the past or present, and provides you with the available shows and movies on netlfix.\n","\n","Signature Recognition (1.3):\n","\n","For the signature recognition it looks at images or scans of signatures. So when looking at electronic signatures it considers features like pressure, speed, and the angle of the signature and style of writing. This helps in verifying if a signature is genuine.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"l_I2f4C85yNF"},"source":["\n","2.

Answer here\n","* 2.1: I would use classification.  As we are putting emails in specific groups, like sorting them into labeled boxes. This is called classification. \n","\n","* 2.2: I would use regression because when predicting a continous numeric it is like finding a pattern in the past stock prices and trends to predict a specific number for the future. The program learns to estimate and predict a continuous output value.\n","\n","* 2.3: A classification algorithm is best for this situation because it's similar to training a system to recognize visual features and categorise the images into different species.\n","\n","* 2.4: For this situation were you want to predict the likelihood of a patient having a particular disease  based on their medical hisotry and diagnostic test result. The most appropriate algorithm would be Classification because we are creating a system that can examine different factors to decide whether a patient has a specific disease.

Therefore using anomaly detection algorithm like clustering will be able to identify patterns in the data without needing labelled data to discover anomalies, it will discover patterns by its own.\n","\n","* 3.2 I would use supervised learning because we are predicting customer lifetime value so we can predict an outcome, using transaction data and customer demographics which are the labeled training data, allowing the model to learn from patterns and relationships. Also, as the customer lifetime value is a continuous variable we could also use regression to predict output values.\n","\n","* 3.3: I would use unsupervised machine learning algorithm because it is ideal for finding and revealing patterns and relationships within a dataset without labeled examples or predefined categories. In this situation we are segmenting customers based on their characteristics therefore, the algorithm will learn and discover these segments on its own.\n","\n","* 3.4: I would use unsupervised machine learning algorithms for analysing social media posts to categorise them into different themes.

Using this labeled data can provide guidance to the algorithms to learn from known fraudalent transactions and which are legitimate therefore, it will be understand patterns in the data. \n","\n","* 4.2: I would use semi-supervised machine learning algorithms because as theres is only small portion of the data is labelled with satisfaction ratings.
